HW91 -- Deque the Halls
2022-04-13
time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- Writing and implementing the code for Deque was pretty easy using pass-thru functionality
of LinkedLists, since everything that we wanted Deques to do were already apart of that class.
- addFirst and removeLast follow FILO functionality, while addLast and removeFirst follow FIFO
functionality.
  - For this reason, a deque can be thought of as a list that has properties of both a queue
  and of a stack.

QCC:
- Why are Deques useful, as opposed to just using the already existing LinkedList and
DoublyLinkedLists that we've already made?
