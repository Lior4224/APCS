Compile-Time Errors
  Error with the syntax
    Ex. Missing semicolon
  Fix one error at a time starting with first one
  Check for:
    Properly nested parentheses and brackets
    Uppercase vs lowercase
    Semicolons
    Quotation marks(double for strings, single for characters)
    Matching types on left and right for each assignment statement
    Right order and type for each method invocation
    Right type object for instance method invocation
Run-Time Errors
  Error while program is running
    Ex. Infinite recursion loop → StackOverflowError
  Infinite loop → add print statement with values of variables and value of condition
  Infinite recursion → check for base case, add print statement with parameters at beginning of method 
  If not sure of flow of execution, add print statements to beginning of each method
-Exceptions
    NullPointerException - trying to access a variable/invoke a method on an object that is null
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - self explanatory, add print statements to show value of index / length of array
    StackOverflowError - infinite recursion
    FileNotFoundException - self explanatory
    ArithmeticException - ex. division by zero
Logic Errors
  Errors causing the program to do the wrong thing.
    Ex. Expression not evaluated in expected order
  Check if something is/isn’t happening that isn’t/is supposed to
  Check for:
    Int division rounds toward zero
    Floating point numbers are not perfectly accurate
    == checks if objects are identical, .equals checks equivalence
  Split up complex expressions into a series of assignments to temporary variables
